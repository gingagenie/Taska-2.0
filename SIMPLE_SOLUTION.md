# Simple Solution for FK Constraint Issue

## The Problem
Drizzle is trying to create a FK constraint that already exists, causing deployment failures.

## The Solution
**Don't use Drizzle migrations for this constraint.** 

Since you've already run the SQL fixes and the constraint exists and works:

1. **In production console, verify the constraint exists:**
   ```sql
   SELECT constraint_name FROM information_schema.table_constraints 
   WHERE table_name = 'customers' AND constraint_name = 'customers_org_id_fkey';
   ```

2. **Tell Drizzle to ignore this constraint by removing it from schema:**
   ```typescript
   // In shared/schema.ts, change this:
   orgId: uuid("org_id").references(() => organizations.id).notNull(),
   
   // To this:
   orgId: uuid("org_id").notNull(),
   ```

3. **The FK constraint still exists in the database and works fine.** Drizzle just won't try to manage it.

4. **Deploy without Drizzle trying to recreate the constraint.**

## Why This Works
- The actual FK constraint exists in the database and enforces data integrity
- Drizzle won't try to create what it doesn't know about
- Your application continues to work exactly the same

This is a pragmatic solution that gets around Drizzle's migration conflicts.
